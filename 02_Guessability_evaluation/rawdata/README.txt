Notes
# dyad 0 - pilot data, excluded from analysis
# dyad 18 - same as for dyad 44, but experiment broke after 1 whole condition (gebaren), plus 1 or two trials for a condition (geluiden). Two remaining conditions (geluiden, combinatie) have been run through in the reinitiated experiment.
# dyad 68 - is missing - withdrawal of consent
# dyad 44 - experiment broke in the middle of the part 2, it was reinitiated but only for missing condition (geluiden). The experiment broke only after finishing completely two conditions (gebaren, combinatie). Therefore there are 3 files, but those with _reinitiated and _broken can be ignored. Moreover, note that the final file will have non-matching experimental time, so that for the vocal condition (reinitiated experiment), the time doesn't fit to the previous data
# dyad 49 - for part 1, accidentally presented with stimuli for dyad 48, meaning that for part 2, some meanings repeats
# dyad 60 - there was some error with a video file, so participants redid the whole part 1. Therefore there are two files and _broken can be ignored. However, maybe whole 60_1 should be excluded as participants were doing the same concepts (or the broken file should be considered, but the video data are not there for this one). For now, second re-run is named as re-initiated but the actual first part is used (to be discussed)
