# FLESH_Expressibility_vs_guessability

/dataset

All dataframes that are used in scripts, or are results of scripts

/numberbatch

ConceptNet embeddings

/rawdata

All log files from sessions

In this folder, there are following scripts

Data_wrangle.ipynb: used to take all raw data and summarize them into single dataframe
ConceptNet_similarity.ipynb: used to calculate cosine similarity between each concept-answer pair and add some other info (e.g., expressibility)



TODO:
- fill in missing cosine similarities
